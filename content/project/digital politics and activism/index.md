Focusing on the shifting communication ecologies and changing media environment, this line of research investigates the dynamics of (dis/mis)information flows, their relationships with external events and news media coverage, and democratic consequences such as political actions and social trust. Some of my research further look at dissemination of Russian disinformation messages in online sphere and their infiltration into the US media system.
