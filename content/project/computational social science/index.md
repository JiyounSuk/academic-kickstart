To answer my overarching research questions, I employ computational approaches to identify networked information flows and communication dynamics.

To be specific, I use:
+ Natural language processing: text processing, POS tagging/parsing, dependency analysis, LDA/structural topic modeling, sentiment analysis
+ Machine learning: PCA, cluster analysis, SVM, logistic regression
+ Social network analysis

Below are selected publications and manuscripts in progress that highlight computational techniques.
