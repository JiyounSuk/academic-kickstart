I am a Ph.D. candidate in the School of Journalism and Mass Communication at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I am also Helen Firstbrook Franklin Wisconsin Distinguished Graduate Fellow.

I study how people understand politics through a lens of identities, local communities, and networked media ecologies surround them. To do so, I employ computational approaches to identify information flows and communication dynamics.

In my disseration, I examine how structural inequalities in localities and networked communication flows surrounding individuals interply to influence polarized trust in social groups and institutions. I triangulate computational, contextual, and public opinion data with a goal of identifying the nature of networked communication flows and local contexts in which individuals are embedded and linking with the self-reported panel data.

I am well-versed in conducting computational communication research and specifically adept in using R and Python. Throughout my doctoral program, I have been working as the Knight Scholar of [Communications and Civic Renewal](https://mcrc.journalism.wisc.edu/groups/cccp/) with guidance of Profs. Dhavan Shah, Lew Friedland, Michael Wagner, Katherine Cramer, and Chris Wells, and participated in various research groups as a student lead or member ([Social Media and Democracy Group](https://mcrc.journalism.wisc.edu/groups/smad/), [International Communication Research Group](https://mcrc.journalism.wisc.edu/groups/icrg/), and [Computational Methods Research Group](https://computational.journalism.wisc.edu/)).

Besides research, I really love cycling and jogging! I am also a huge animal lover. I enjoy drawing cartoons (Meet Rocky in Gallery).
