I am a Ph.D. candidate in the School of Journalism and Mass Communication at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I am also the Helen Firstbrook Franklin Wisconsin Distinguished Graduate Fellow for 2020-2021.

I study how people understand politics in the digital age through a lens of identities, communities, and networked communication structure surround them. To do so, I employ **computational approaches** to identify (dis/mis)information flows and communication dynamics. My dissertaion looks at structural inequalities in localties, networked communication, and social cohesion. 

I am well-versed in natural language processing, community detection, unsupervised and supervised machine learning, using *R* and *Python* (see **computational communication research** project below). I also use *ArcGIS* for spatial analysis. Throughout my doctoral program, I have been working as the Knight Scholar of [Communications and Civic Renewal](https://mcrc.journalism.wisc.edu/groups/cccp/) with the guidance of Profs. Dhavan Shah, Lew Friedland, Michael Wagner, Katherine Cramer, and Chris Wells, and participated in various research groups as a student lead or member ([Social Media and Democracy Group](https://mcrc.journalism.wisc.edu/groups/smad/), [International Communication Research Group](https://mcrc.journalism.wisc.edu/groups/icrg/), and [Computational Methods Research Group](https://computational.journalism.wisc.edu/)).

Besides research, I really love cycling and jogging! I am also a huge animal lover. I enjoy drawing cartoons (Meet Rocky in [Gallery](https://jiyounsuk.github.io/#gallery)).
